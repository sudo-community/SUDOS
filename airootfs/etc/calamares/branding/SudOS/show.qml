/* This is a simple slideshow for use during the *exec* phase of
 * installation, that displays a handful of slides. It uses
 * the *Presentation* QML components -- this allows, for instance,
 * notes to be added to slides, and for arrow navigation to be
 * used. But at its core it's just a bunch of images, repeating.
 *
 * For this kind of limited functionality, it may be better to
 * use the "plain images" slideshow format in Calamares, although
 * then you don't have any say in how things are animated.
 *
 * This slideshow is written for *slideshowAPI* version 1, so in
 * `branding.desc` set that appropriately.

/* *Presentation* comes from the pre-installed calamares.slideshow
 * that comes with Calamares itself. See `Presentation.qml` in the
 * Calamares repository for details and documentation.
 *
 * The important parts of presentation are:
 *  - it has a property *activatedInCalamares* which is set to *true*
 *    when the slideshow becomes visible, *false* afterwards.
 *  - it expects one or more children with a property *isSlide*
 *    set to *true*.
 *  - it has a function *goToNextSlide()* to do just that (where
 *    "slides" is the sequence of children that have property
 *    *isSlide* set to *true*.
